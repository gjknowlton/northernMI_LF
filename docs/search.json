    "text": "Summary\n\nMajor changes have occurred in the landcover of northern lower peninsula of Michigan as of 2022. However, care should be taken when directly comparing past and present maps, as classification systems for present Biophysical Settings have been updated to align with the most current NatureServe (2016) ecosystem descriptions. With this caveat in mind, some patterns are worth noting:\nNorthern hardwood forests and hardwood swamps are still the dominant ecosystem classes. However, we no longer see the prominance of hemlock forests, pine-oak barrens, or northern pine-oak forests. Much of the region has been fragmented and agricultural land cover has become prominent.\nMuch of the region remains forested, but changes in forest composition and structure have occurred widely. Partly this can be attributed to the current forests coming back after widespread logging in the 19th century. The loss of pine-oak barrens is likely due to fire suppression."

    "text": "Summary\n\nHistorically, more than 35% of northern Michigan was covered by hemlock-dominated northern hardwood forest. Also prevalent in the region were hardwood swamps, pine-oak forests, and pine-oak barrens. The geographic distributions of these ecosystem types are clear, with hemlock forests dominating in the western half of the region, pine-oak barrens prominent in the central portion, and pine-hemlock forests as you approach Lake Huron on the eastern half. Moving below the floristic tension zone, beech-maple forests appear.\nThe vast majority of fire was concentrated in pine-oak barren ecosystems dominated by jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and northern pin oak (idk). Here, over 200,000 acres burned annually pre-European colonization. Mean fire return intervals were between 0-25 years for this ecosystem type, with most of this being surface fire.\nOther fire return intervals were typically above 50-75 years. Wind and weather were the major distrubances in the other ecosystem types."
