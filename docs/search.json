Also prevalent in the region were hardwood swamps, pine-oak forests, and pine-oak barrens. The geographic distributions of these ecosystem types are clear, with hemlock forests dominating in the western half of the region, pine-oak barrens prominent in the central portion, and pine-hemlock forests as you approach Lake Huron on the eastern half. Moving below the floristic tension zone, beech-maple forests appear.\nThe vast majority of fire was concentrated in pine-oak barren ecosystems dominated by jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and oaks including northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), white oak (Quercus alba), northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and black oak (Quercus velutina). Here, over 200,000 acres burned annually pre-European colonization. Mean fire return intervals (all fire types, across all succession classes) were between 0-25 years for this ecosystem type, with most of this being surface fire (mean fire return interval of 5 years).\nThe vast majority of fire was concentrated in pine-oak barren ecosystems dominated by jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and northern pin oak.

However, care should be taken when directly comparing past and present maps, as classification systems for present Biophysical Settings have been updated to align with the most current NatureServe (2016) ecosystem descriptions. With this caveat in mind, some patterns are worth noting:\nNorthern hardwood forests and hardwood swamps are still the dominant ecosystem classes. However, we no longer see the prominence of hemlock forests, pine-oak barrens, or northern pine-oak forests. Much of the region has been fragmented and agricultural land cover has become prominent.\nMuch of the region remains forested, but changes in forest composition and structure have occurred widely. Partly this can be attributed to the current forests coming back after widespread logging in the 19th century. The loss of pine-oak barrens is likely due to fire suppression."
